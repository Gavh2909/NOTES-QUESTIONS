## 12. How does Docker handle versioning of images?

- Docker uses tags to version images, allowing users to specify a particular version when pulling an image.
- Images without tags default to the 'latest' tag, representing the most recent version.
- It's good practice to use versioned tags for reproducibility and avoid reliance on the 'latest' tag.

## 13. Explain the significance of the "docker-compose up" command.

- `docker-compose up` is used to start the services defined in a Docker Compose file.
- It creates and starts containers for all services, ensuring they are properly configured and linked.
- This command simplifies the deployment of multi-container applications.

## 14. What are Docker containers used for in a microservices architecture?

- In a microservices architecture, Docker containers provide lightweight and isolated runtime environments for individual services.
- Containers encapsulate each microservice, making it easier to scale, deploy, and update independently.
- Docker containers enhance the modularity and flexibility of microservices.

## 15. How does Docker support continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)?

- Docker facilitates CI/CD by creating consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- Containers ensure that the application runs consistently in various stages of the deployment pipeline.
- Docker images can be versioned and pushed to registries, enabling seamless deployment and rollback processes.

## 16. What is Docker Swarm Mode?

- Docker Swarm Mode is an integrated orchestration feature introduced in Docker Engine 1.12.
- It simplifies the management of a cluster of Docker hosts, providing native support for swarm services, nodes, and tasks.
- Docker Swarm Mode enables the easy deployment and scaling of applications across a swarm.

## 17. How do you share data between containers in Docker?

- Docker volumes and bind mounts are two ways to share data between containers.
- Volumes provide persistent storage, while bind mounts link to a specific directory on the host.
- Both options allow multiple containers to access shared data, promoting data consistency.

## 18. Explain the use of the "docker-compose down" command.

- `docker-compose down` stops and removes the containers defined in the Docker Compose file.
- It also removes networks and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.
- This command is useful for cleaning up resources after stopping a multi-container application.

## 19. What is Docker Swarm Overlay Network?

- Docker Swarm Overlay Network enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts.
- It creates a virtual network that spans the entire swarm, ensuring seamless connectivity.
- Overlay networks in Docker Swarm simplify service discovery and enable load balancing.

## 20. How can you pass environment variables to a Docker container?

- Environment variables can be set in a Dockerfile using the `ENV` instruction.
- When running a container, use the `-e` option to pass environment variables via the command line.
- Docker Compose files also support the definition and use of environment variables.

## 21. Explain the concept of Docker Health Checks.

- Docker Health Checks are used to monitor the status of a containerized application.
- Health checks verify if the application inside the container is responding as expected.
- Docker automatically restarts containers that fail health checks, improving overall system reliability.

## 22. What is the purpose of the "docker system prune" command?

- `docker system prune` removes all unused objects such as containers, volumes, and networks.
- It helps free up disk space by cleaning up resources that are no longer in use.
- Use this command cautiously, as it permanently deletes unused objects.

## 23. How does Docker handle secrets management?

- Docker Swarm provides a secrets management feature for securely managing sensitive data.
