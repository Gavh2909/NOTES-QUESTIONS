# **Java Interview Questions**

1. **What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?**
   - `==` compares object references, while `.equals()` compares the content of objects.

   ```java
   String str1 = new String("Hello");
   String str2 = new String("Hello");
   boolean result = (str1 == str2); // false
   boolean isEqual = str1.equals(str2); // true
   ```

2. **Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java.**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.

   ```java
   interface Shape {
       void draw();
   }

   class Circle implements Shape {
       void draw() { /* Circle specific draw logic */ }
   }

   Shape shape = new Circle(); // Polymorphism
   shape.draw(); // Calls Circle's draw method
   ```

3. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**
   - `ArrayList` uses a dynamic array, while `LinkedList` uses a doubly-linked list.

   ```java
   // ArrayList
   ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
   arrayList.add("Item 1");
   String item = arrayList.get(0);

   // LinkedList
   LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
   linkedList.add("Item 1");
   String item = linkedList.get(0);
   ```

4. **Explain the concept of encapsulation in Java.**
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

   ```java
   public class Car {
       private String model;

       public String getModel() {
           return model;
       }

       public void setModel(String model) {
           this.model = model;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **How does Java handle runtime polymorphism?**
   - Java uses method overriding and dynamic method dispatch to achieve runtime polymorphism.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }

   Animal myPet = new Dog();
   myPet.makeSound(); // Calls Dog's makeSound at runtime
   ```

6. **What is the `NullPointerException` in Java?**
   - `NullPointerException` occurs when you try to access or call methods on an object that is `null`.

   ```java
   String str = null;
   int length = str.length(); // Throws NullPointerException
   ```

7. **Explain the `final` keyword in Java.**
   - The `final` keyword is used to make a variable, method, or class unchangeable.

   ```java
   final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
   final void myMethod() { /* Method implementation */ }
   ```

8. **What is the purpose of the `super` keyword in Java?**
   - The `super` keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class's members (fields or methods).

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void eat() {
           System.out.println("Animal is eating");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void eat() {
           super.eat(); // Calls Animal's eat method
           System.out.println("Dog is eating");
       }
   }
   ```

9. **Explain the difference between `throw` and `throws` in Java.**
   - `throw` is used to explicitly throw an exception, while `throws` is used in method declarations to indicate that the method may throw an exception.

   ```java
   void myMethod() throws MyException {
       // Method logic
   }

   void anotherMethod() {
       throw new MyException("This is an exception");
   }
   ```

10. **What is the purpose of the `static` keyword in Java?**
    - The `static` keyword is used to create class-level members (variables or methods) that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

    ```java
    class MathUtil {
        static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }

    int result = MathUtil.add(5, 3); // Accessing static method without instance
    ```

**11. Explain the concept of method overloading in Java.**
   - Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

   ```java
   class Calculator {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }

   Calculator myCalc = new Calculator();
   int sumInt = myCalc.add(5, 3);
   double sumDouble = myCalc.add(5.5, 3.2);
   ```

**12. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in Java?**
   - The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.

   ```java
   class Person {
       private String name;

       void setName(String name) {
           this.name = name; // Refers to the instance variable 'name'
       }
   }
   ```

**13. Explain the use of the `transient` keyword in Java.**
   - The `transient` keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized during object serialization.

   ```java
   class MyClass implements java.io.Serializable {
       transient int myTransientVariable;
       int myNonTransientVariable;
   }
   ```

**14. What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java?**
   - The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads simultaneously.

   ```java
   class SharedResource {
       volatile boolean flag = false;
   }
   ```

**15. How does the `try`, `catch`, `finally` block work in Java exception handling?**
   - The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception, `catch` block handles the exception, and `finally` block contains code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (ExceptionType ex) {
       // Handle the exception
   } finally {
       // Code that always executes
   }
   ```

**16. Explain the concept of an anonymous class in Java.**
   - An anonymous class is a class without a name that is defined on the fly for creating an object.

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       void myMethod();
   }

   MyInterface myObj = new MyInterface() {
       public void myMethod() {
           System.out.println("Anonymous class implementation");
       }
   };
   ```

**17. What is the purpose of the `enum` keyword in Java?**
   - The `enum` keyword is used to define a fixed set of constants.

   ```java
   enum Day {
       SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
   }

   Day currentDay = Day.MONDAY;
   ```

**18. Explain the concept of a thread-safe class in Java.**
   - A thread-safe class is designed to safely support multiple threads accessing its methods without causing data inconsistency or other issues.

   ```java
   class ThreadSafeCounter {
       private int count = 0;

       synchronized void increment() {
           count++;
       }
   }
   ```

**19. What is the purpose of the `clone()` method in Java?**
   - The `clone()` method is used to create a copy of an object.

   ```java
   class MyClass implements Cloneable {
       int value;

       public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
           return super.clone();
       }
   }

   MyClass originalObj = new MyClass();
   MyClass clonedObj = (MyClass) originalObj.clone();
   ```

**20. Explain the concept of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).**
   - JVM is an abstract machine that provides the runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It interprets the bytecode or compiles it to native machine code for the host machine.


**21. What is the purpose of the `finalize()` method in Java?**
   - The `finalize()` method is called by the garbage collector before an object is garbage-collected. It allows performing cleanup operations.

   ```java
   class MyClass {
       protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
           // Cleanup operations
       }
   }
   ```

**22. Explain the concept of the `super()` keyword in constructors.**
   - The `super()` keyword is used to call the constructor of the immediate parent class.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       Animal() {
           System.out.println("Animal constructor");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       Dog() {
           super(); // Calls Animal's constructor
           System.out.println("Dog constructor");
       }
   }
   ```

**23. What is the difference between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`?**
   - `StringBuilder` is not thread-safe, and `StringBuffer` is thread-safe because it is synchronized.

   ```java
   // StringBuilder (not thread-safe)
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
   sb.append(" World");

   // StringBuffer (thread-safe)
   StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");
   buffer.append(" World");
   ```

**24. Explain the concept of autoboxing and unboxing in Java.**
   - Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive data types to their corresponding wrapper classes, and unboxing is the reverse.

   ```java
   // Autoboxing
   Integer intValue = 42;

   // Unboxing
   int intValueUnboxed = intValue;
   ```

**25. What is the purpose of the `break` statement in Java?**
   - The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop or switch statement prematurely.

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i == 5) {
           break; // Exits the loop when i is 5
       }
   }
   ```

**26. Explain the concept of a singleton class in Java.**
   - A singleton class ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

   ```java
   class Singleton {
       private static Singleton instance;

       private Singleton() {}

       public static Singleton getInstance() {
           if (instance == null) {
               instance = new Singleton();
           }
           return instance;
       }
   }
   ```

**27. What is the purpose of the `instanceof` operator in Java?**
   - The `instanceof` operator is used to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.

   ```java
   class Animal {}

   Animal myPet = new Animal();
   if (myPet instanceof Animal) {
       // Code to execute if myPet is an instance of Animal
   }
   ```

**28. Explain the concept of garbage collection in Java.**
   - Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable.

   ```java
   class MyClass {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyClass obj = new MyClass();
           // obj is eligible for garbage collection after it goes out of scope
       }
   }
   ```

**29. What is the purpose of the `abstract` keyword in Java?**
   - The `abstract` keyword is used to declare abstract classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

   ```java
   abstract class Shape {
       abstract void draw();
   }
   ```

**30. Explain the concept of method references in Java.**
   - Method references provide a shorthand notation for lambda expressions to call methods by their names.

   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

**31. What is the purpose of the `try-with-resources` statement in Java?**
   - The `try-with-resources` statement is used for automatic resource management. It automatically closes resources (e.g., `AutoCloseable` objects) when the try block finishes, whether it finishes normally or with an exception.

   ```java
   try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
       // Code that reads from the file
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Handle the exception
   }
   ```

**32. Explain the concept of the `Comparator` interface in Java.**
   - The `Comparator` interface is used for comparing objects for sorting purposes. It provides a way to implement custom sorting logic.

   ```java
   class Student {
       int id;
       String name;
   }

   // Custom comparator for sorting students by name
   Comparator<Student> nameComparator = Comparator.comparing(student -> student.name);
   ```

**33. What is the purpose of the `assert` keyword in Java?**
   - The `assert` keyword is used for debugging purposes. It checks a given boolean expression and throws an `AssertionError` if the expression is false.

   ```java
   int value = -5;
   assert value > 0 : "Value should be positive";
   ```

**34. Explain the difference between the `continue` and `break` statements in Java.**
   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop's code and proceed to the next iteration, while the `break` statement is used to exit the loop or switch statement.

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i == 5) {
           continue; // Skips the iteration when i is 5
       }
       if (i == 8) {
           break; // Exits the loop when i is 8
       }
   }
   ```

**35. What is the purpose of the `static` block in Java?**
   - The `static` block is used to initialize static variables or to perform any static initialization necessary for the class.

   ```java
   class MyClass {
       static int count;

       static {
           count = 10;
       }
   }
   ```

**36. Explain the concept of the `Lambda` expression in Java.**
   - Lambda expressions provide a concise way to express instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces). They reduce the need for anonymous classes.

   ```java
   // Before Lambda
   Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Hello");
       }
   };

   // Lambda Expression
   Runnable runnableLambda = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
   ```

**37. What is the purpose of the `Math` class in Java?**
   - The `Math` class in Java provides mathematical operations such as basic arithmetic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.

   ```java
   double result = Math.sqrt(25); // Calculates the square root
   ```

**38. Explain the concept of the `Diamond Operator` (`<>`) in Java.**
   - The diamond operator (`<>`) is used for type inference in generic classes. It allows you to instantiate a generic class without specifying the type arguments explicitly.

   ```java
   List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>(); // Diamond Operator
   ```

**39. What is the purpose of the `File` class in Java?**
   - The `File` class is used to represent files and directories in the file system. It provides methods to manipulate file paths, create, delete, and inspect files.

   ```java
   File myFile = new File("example.txt");
   ```

**40. Explain the concept of the `default` method in Java interfaces.**
   - The `default` method in Java interfaces provides a way to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementation classes.

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       void myMethod();

       default void defaultMethod() {
           System.out.println("Default method implementation");
       }
   }
   ```


**41. What is the purpose of the `Stream` API in Java?**
   - The `Stream` API is used for processing sequences of elements. It provides a functional approach to processing collections of objects.

   ```java
   List<String> myList = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");
   myList.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("A")).forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

**42. Explain the concept of the `volatile` modifier in Java.**
   - The `volatile` modifier is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads simultaneously, ensuring visibility of changes to other threads.

   ```java
   class SharedResource {
       volatile boolean flag = false;
   }
   ```

**43. What is the purpose of the `StringBuilder` class in Java?**
   - The `StringBuilder` class is used to represent mutable sequences of characters. It provides an efficient way to concatenate strings without creating new objects.

   ```java
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
   sb.append(" World");
   ```

**44. Explain the concept of the `Deque` interface in Java.**
   - The `Deque` interface represents a double-ended queue, allowing elements to be added or removed from both ends. It extends the `Queue` interface.

   ```java
   Deque<String> deque = new LinkedList<>();
   deque.addFirst("First");
   deque.addLast("Last");
   ```

**45. What is the purpose of the `::` operator in method references?**
   - The `::` operator is used to create method references, a shorthand notation for lambda expressions to call methods by their names.

   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

**46. Explain the concept of the `Path` interface in Java.**
   - The `Path` interface represents a file or directory path. It is part of the `java.nio.file` package and provides methods for working with file paths.

   ```java
   Path filePath = Paths.get("example.txt");
   ```

**47. What is the purpose of the `@Override` annotation in Java?**
   - The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method in its superclass.

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

**48. Explain the concept of the `try`-with-multiple-catch block in Java.**
   - The `try` block can be followed by multiple `catch` blocks, each handling a specific type of exception.

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw exceptions
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Handle IOException
   } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
       // Handle IllegalArgumentException
   }
   ```

**49. What is the purpose of the `StringJoiner` class in Java?**
   - The `StringJoiner` class is used to construct a sequence of characters separated by a delimiter. It is particularly useful for joining strings with a specified delimiter.

   ```java
   StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(", ");
   joiner.add("Apple").add("Banana").add("Orange");
   String result = joiner.toString();
   ```

**50. Explain the concept of the `java.time` package in Java.**
   - The `java.time` package provides classes for handling date and time. It includes classes such as `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, and more.

   ```java
   LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now();
   ```
