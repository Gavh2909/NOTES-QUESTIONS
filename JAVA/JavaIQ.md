### 1. Different between normal hashmap and concurrent hashmap?

 ### 2. Immutability concept.
   - immuntability in java refers to the property of an object whose state cannot be modified after it has been created.
   - 1. How to make a class immutable?
   - Make the class itself 'final' to prevent it from being extended.
   - Declare fields as 'final' to ensure they cannot be modified after initialization.
   - Use a private cunstructor to control object creation and initialization.
   - Donâ€™t provide setter methods for variables.
    ### Mutable and immutable string:
   - In java strings are immutable by default. Once a String object is created, its content cannot be changed.
   - However, if you use StringBuilder or StringBuffer you are working with mutable String-like objects.

### 3. WHat is concurrent apps?
- refers to programs or systems that are designed to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously.
- Can be achieved usng threads or processes. Threads are lighter-weight units of execution within a process, while processes are independent programs with their own memory space.
  
### 4. Threading and multi-threading  **  [DONE]

### 5. Wrapper Classes.   [Done]
- A Wrapper class in Java is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types

### 6. How to make a class immutable? [DONE]

### 7. Different between jaa 8 and 7

### 8. stream, filter, map in arraylist[done]
    ```
    //STREAM 
        Stream<String> stream=list.stream();
        stream.filter(s->s.startsWith("f")).forEach(System.out::println);
        //fILTER
        List<String> filteredlist=list.stream().filter(s->s.length()>5).collect(Collectors.toList());
    ```

### 9. What is method reference?[done]

### 10. what is SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN in syso?
- system.out.println is a java statement used to print output to the console.
- it belongs to java.lang package and its a member of system class

  ### 11. Variable length arguments in java?

12. JRM ,JDK, JVM
    - What runs on a machine(JVM) is bytecode 

- Type java code -> Compile it --> converted into bytecode

- JVM : The space where actual code will run [Java Virtual macine] if there only JVM installed we can run our java code

- But if that code needs some extra packages like List, HashMap then we need one external thing for that.[JRE-> Java Runtime Environment]

- JRE -> 
   - JVM is a part of JRE.

- JDK : Top layer -> After installing JDK u'll get JRE and JVM
