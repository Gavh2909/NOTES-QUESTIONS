### 1. Different between normal hashmap and concurrent hashmap?
- `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are both implementations of the `Map` interface in Java, but they have significant differences, especially in terms of thread-safety and performance in concurrent environments:

#### 1. **Thread Safety:**
   - **HashMap:** `HashMap` is not thread-safe. If multiple threads try to modify the `HashMap` concurrently, it can lead to data corruption or infinite loops. You need to synchronize access to a `HashMap` explicitly using external synchronization (e.g., `Collections.synchronizedMap(map)`).
   - **ConcurrentHashMap:** `ConcurrentHashMap` is designed to be thread-safe without the need for external synchronization. It supports concurrent reads and writes. Different segments of the map can be updated concurrently, which can lead to better performance in highly concurrent scenarios.

#### 2. **Segmentation:**
   - **HashMap:** A regular `HashMap` is not divided into segments. When multiple threads try to update the map simultaneously, they can interfere with each other.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap:** `ConcurrentHashMap` is internally divided into segments. Each segment acts as an independent hash table, and different segments can be updated concurrently. This helps to minimize contention and provides better concurrency.

#### 3. **Locking Strategy:**
   - **HashMap:** It uses a single lock for the entire map during modifications. This means that if one thread is modifying the map, other threads are blocked, leading to potential performance bottlenecks in a highly concurrent environment.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap:** It uses a finer-grained locking strategy. Each segment has its own lock, allowing multiple threads to operate on different segments simultaneously. This reduces contention and improves concurrency.

#### 4. **Iterators:**
   - **HashMap:** If the `HashMap` is modified while iterating over it (except through the iterator's own `remove` method), it can lead to `ConcurrentModificationException`.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap:** Iterators of `ConcurrentHashMap` provide weakly consistent views. They reflect the state of the map at some point in time and do not throw `ConcurrentModificationException` even if the map is modified during iteration.

#### 5. **Performance:**
   - **HashMap:** In a single-threaded environment or when there is limited contention, a regular `HashMap` might perform well.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap:** In highly concurrent scenarios, where multiple threads are frequently reading and writing, `ConcurrentHashMap` is designed to provide better performance by allowing concurrent updates to different segments.

- In summary, `ConcurrentHashMap` is a more suitable choice in concurrent environments due to its built-in thread-safety and better support for concurrent operations. If you are dealing with a single-threaded environment or can ensure external synchronization, a regular `HashMap` may be sufficient.

 ### 2. Immutability concept.
   - immuntability in java refers to the property of an object whose state cannot be modified after it has been created.
   - 1. How to make a class immutable?
   - Make the class itself 'final' to prevent it from being extended.
   - Declare fields as 'final' to ensure they cannot be modified after initialization.
   - Use a private cunstructor to control object creation and initialization.
   - Donâ€™t provide setter methods for variables.
    ### Mutable and immutable string:
   - In java strings are immutable by default. Once a String object is created, its content cannot be changed.
   - However, if you use StringBuilder or StringBuffer you are working with mutable String-like objects.

### 3. WHat is concurrent apps?
- refers to programs or systems that are designed to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously.
- Can be achieved usng threads or processes. Threads are lighter-weight units of execution within a process, while processes are independent programs with their own memory space.

    ```
    //STREAM 
        Stream<String> stream=list.stream();
        stream.filter(s->s.startsWith("f")).forEach(System.out::println);
        //fILTER
        List<String> filteredlist=list.stream().filter(s->s.length()>5).collect(Collectors.toList());
    ```

### 9. What is method reference?[done]

### 10. what is SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN in syso?
- system.out.println is a java statement used to print output to the console.
- it belongs to java.lang package and its a member of system class
- System: this is a class in Java's 'java.lang' package. It provides access to various system-related properties and methods.
- out: This is public static member of the 'System' class and represents the standard output stream. It is an instance of PrintStream class.
- println or print : it is a method of 'PrintStream' class.
- 

### 11. Variable length arguments in java?
- In Java, you can use variable-length argument lists, also known as varargs, to allow a method to accept a variable number of arguments of the same type. Varargs were introduced in Java 5. To use varargs, you specify an ellipsis (...) followed by the argument type in the method parameter declaration.
- 
```
public class VariableLengthArg {
    public static int sum(int... numbers){
        int result=0;
        
        for(int n:numbers){
            result+=n;
        }
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(sum(1,2,3));
    }
}
```

### 12. JRM ,JDK, JVM
    - What runs on a machine(JVM) is bytecode 

- Type java code -> Compile it --> converted into bytecode

- JVM : The space where actual code will run [Java Virtual macine] if there only JVM installed we can run our java code

- But if that code needs some extra packages like List, HashMap then we need one external thing for that.[JRE-> Java Runtime Environment]

- JRE -> 
   - JVM is a part of JRE.

- JDK : Top layer -> After installing JDK u'll get JRE and JVM

### 14. is there a diference between int i=9 and int i=09
- Yes, there is a difference between int i = 9 and int i = 09 in Java.

- In the first case, int i = 9, you are assigning the decimal value 9 to the variable i. This is a straightforward assignment of an integer literal in base 10.

- In the second case, int i = 09, the leading zero indicates that the value is specified in octal (base 8). In octal representation, valid digits are 0 through 7. Therefore, 09 is not a valid octal number because 9 is not a valid octal digit. If you try to compile code with int i = 09, it will result in a compilation error.

### 15. What is base class?
- In object-oriented programming, classes can be organized into hierarchies where one class inherits properties and behaviors from another. The class that is being inherited from is called the "superclass" or "base class," and the class that inherits from it is called the "subclass" or "derived class."

### 16. base class vs abstract class?
#### Base Class:
- In a general sense, a "base class" refers to any class that is extended or inherited by another class.
- The term is not explicitly used in Java, but it's common to refer to the superclass in a class hierarchy as the "base class."
- The base class provides a common set of attributes and behaviors that can be reused by its subclasses.

#### An abstract class :
- in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain abstract methods.
- Abstract methods are declared without an implementation in the abstract class and must be implemented by concrete (non-abstract) subclasses.
- Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract (concrete) methods.
- used to achieve abstarction like interface.
```
 abstract class Shape { //abstract class
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method
    
    void resize() {
        System.out.println("Resizing the shape");
    }
}

// Concrete subclass
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}
```

### 16: Interface-
- In Java, an interface is a reference type that is similar to a class. It is a collection of abstract methods. When a class implements an interface, it inherits the abstract methods defined in that interface. Additionally, starting from Java 8, interfaces can also include default and static methods with implementations.
- used to achieve abstraction like abstract class.

Here are some key points about interfaces in Java:

1. **Declaration:**
   - You declare an interface using the `interface` keyword.
   - Example:

     ```java
     interface MyInterface {
         void abstractMethod(); // Abstract method (implicitly public and abstract)
         
         default void defaultMethod() {
             // Default method with implementation
             System.out.println("Default method");
         }

         static void staticMethod() {
             // Static method with implementation
             System.out.println("Static method");
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Abstract Methods:**
   - In an interface, methods are implicitly public and abstract. You don't need to use the `public` or `abstract` modifiers explicitly.
   - Example:

     ```java
     interface MyInterface {
         void abstractMethod(); // Abstract method
     }
     ```

3. **Default Methods:**
   - Starting from Java 8, interfaces can include default methods, which provide a default implementation.
   - Classes implementing the interface can choose to override the default method.
   - Example:

     ```java
     interface MyInterface {
         default void defaultMethod() {
             System.out.println("Default method");
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Static Methods:**
   - Starting from Java 8, interfaces can include static methods with an implementation.
   - Static methods are associated with the interface, not with instances of implementing classes.
   - Example:

     ```java
     interface MyInterface {
         static void staticMethod() {
             System.out.println("Static method");
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Implementing an Interface:**
   - To use an interface in a class, you use the `implements` keyword.
   - Example:

     ```java
     class MyClass implements MyInterface {
         @Override
         public void abstractMethod() {
             System.out.println("Implemented abstract method");
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - Unlike classes, a class can implement multiple interfaces in Java, enabling a form of multiple inheritance through interfaces.
   - Example:

     ```java
     interface Interface1 {
         // methods
     }

     interface Interface2 {
         // methods
     }

     class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
         // Implementation of methods from Interface1 and Interface2
     }
     ```


### 17. Abstract class vs Interface.
In Java, both abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction, but they have some key differences in terms of functionality and usage. Here are the main distinctions between abstract classes and interfaces:

1. **Abstract Class:**
   - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain both abstract and concrete methods.
   - Abstract methods declared in an abstract class are implicitly abstract and must be implemented by concrete subclasses.
   - An abstract class can have instance variables (fields), constructors (including a default constructor), and non-abstract methods with or without implementations.
   - It supports the concept of constructors, which can be used to initialize instance variables and perform other tasks during object creation.
   - A class can extend only one abstract class.

   Example:

   ```java
   abstract class AbstractClass {
       int commonField;

       AbstractClass(int commonField) {
           this.commonField = commonField;
       }

       abstract void abstractMethod();

       void concreteMethod() {
           System.out.println("Concrete method");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Interface:**
   - An interface is a collection of abstract methods, default methods, and static methods. Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have methods with implementations.
   - All methods declared in an interface are implicitly public and abstract (except for static and default methods).
   - Interfaces can't have instance variables (fields), constructors, or non-abstract methods with implementations (except for static and default methods).
   - It supports multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.
   - Interfaces are often used to define contracts for classes that implement them.

   Example:

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       void abstractMethod(); // Implicitly public and abstract

       default void defaultMethod() {
           System.out.println("Default method");
       }

       static void staticMethod() {
           System.out.println("Static method");
       }
   }
   ```

**When to Use Abstract Class vs Interface:**

- Use an abstract class when you want to provide a common base class for other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes are useful for sharing code and providing a common structure.

- Use an interface when you want to define a contract that multiple classes can implement. Interfaces are more suitable for scenarios where a class may need to inherit from multiple sources.

- If you need to provide a default implementation for some methods, use an abstract class. If you want to define a contract without providing any default implementation, use an interface.

In some cases, a combination of abstract classes and interfaces may be used to achieve the desired level of abstraction and code reuse in a Java application.


### 18. functional interface. 

In Java, a functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. Functional interfaces are a key concept in the functional programming paradigm introduced in Java 8 with the addition of lambda expressions and the `java.util.function` package.

Here are the characteristics of a functional interface:

1. **Single Abstract Method (SAM):**
   - A functional interface should declare exactly one abstract method. This method is often referred to as the "functional method" or "single abstract method" (SAM).
   - The presence of a single abstract method allows instances of functional interfaces to be created using lambda expressions or method references.

2. **Optional Default and Static Methods:**
   - A functional interface can have additional default methods or static methods with implementations, but it must have only one abstract method.
   - Default methods provide a default implementation for a method, and static methods are associated with the interface itself.

3. **Annotation:**
   - While not required, it's a good practice to use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation on a functional interface to indicate its intended use as a functional interface. This annotation is optional but helps prevent accidental addition of more than one abstract method.

Here's an example of a functional interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod(); // Single abstract method

    // Optional: Default method
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }

    // Optional: Static method
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method");
    }
}
```

With functional interfaces, you can use lambda expressions to concisely represent instances of these interfaces. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression to create an instance of MyFunctionalInterface
        MyFunctionalInterface functionalInstance = () -> System.out.println("Lambda expression implementation");
        
        // Calling the method defined in the functional interface
        functionalInstance.myMethod();

        // Calling default and static methods
        functionalInstance.defaultMethod();
        MyFunctionalInterface.staticMethod();
    }
}
```

Functional interfaces are commonly used in conjunction with lambda expressions to write more concise and expressive code, particularly when working with features introduced in Java 8 and later, such as the Stream API and the functional programming enhancements.


19. Hashmap hashcode overriden scenario [PENDING]

### 20. Rehashing
- 
Rehashing is a process used in hash-based data structures, such as HashMap, to resize the underlying hash table and reorganize the elements when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold. The load factor is the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the hash table. Rehashing helps in maintaining a reasonable balance between the number of elements and the size of the hash table, ensuring efficient performance.

- In Java, HashMap is an example of a hash-based data structure that uses rehashing. When the number of elements in a HashMap exceeds a certain threshold (determined by the load factor), the HashMap automatically increases the size of the underlying array and rehashes the elements into the new array.

### 21. Criteria for hashmap.
When choosing to use a `HashMap` in Java, you need to consider various factors and criteria to ensure that it is the appropriate data structure for your specific use case. Here are some criteria to consider when deciding whether to use a `HashMap`:

1. **Efficient Lookup:**
   - Use a `HashMap` when you need fast and efficient lookups. The average time complexity for search operations (get and containsKey) in a `HashMap` is O(1).

2. **Key-Value Pairs:**
   - Use a `HashMap` when you have a collection of key-value pairs. It allows you to store and retrieve values based on unique keys.

3. **Uniqueness of Keys:**
   - Each key in a `HashMap` must be unique. If you need to associate unique keys with values, a `HashMap` is suitable.

4. **Null Values:**
   - `HashMap` allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values. If your application needs to handle null keys or values, a `HashMap` is a good choice.

5. **Unordered Elements:**
   - The order of elements in a `HashMap` is not guaranteed. If you don't need a specific order for your elements, a `HashMap` is appropriate.

6. **No Duplicate Values:**
   - While keys must be unique, values can be duplicated. If you need to store duplicate values associated with different keys, a `HashMap` is suitable.

7. **Dynamic Size:**
   - `HashMap` automatically adjusts its size as elements are added or removed. If you have a dynamic set of elements and the size may change frequently, a `HashMap` is a good choice.

8. **Complexity of Operations:**
   - `HashMap` provides O(1) time complexity for basic operations like get, put, and remove in the average case. This makes it efficient for scenarios where these operations are frequently performed.

9. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - `HashMap` uses memory to store key-value pairs. If memory efficiency is a concern, consider the memory requirements of your application and the size of the data set.

10. **Concurrency Considerations:**
    - If your application requires thread safety, consider using `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of a regular `HashMap`. `ConcurrentHashMap` supports concurrent access by multiple threads without the need for external synchronization.

11. **Custom Object Equality:**
    - If you have custom objects as keys, ensure that you override the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods appropriately to maintain the contract required by `HashMap`.

### 22. Can string and stringbuilder and primitive integer, Wrapper Integer be a hashmap key?

Yes, both `String`, `StringBuilder`, and instances of `Integer` (primitive wrapper class for `int`) can be used as keys in a `HashMap` in Java. However, there are some considerations and differences between them:

1. **String as a Key:**
   - `String` is commonly used as a key in a `HashMap`. Strings are immutable, and their hash codes are calculated based on their content.
   - Example:

     ```java
     HashMap<String, Integer> stringHashMap = new HashMap<>();
     stringHashMap.put("one", 1);
     stringHashMap.put("two", 2);
     ```

2. **StringBuilder as a Key:**
   - `StringBuilder` is mutable, and its hash code is calculated based on its current content. However, using a mutable object as a key in a `HashMap` can lead to unexpected behavior if the key is modified after being used in the `HashMap`.
   - It's generally not recommended to use mutable objects as keys in hash-based data structures because modifications can change the hash code, leading to difficulties in retrieving the associated value.

     ```java
     HashMap<StringBuilder, Integer> stringBuilderHashMap = new HashMap<>();
     stringBuilderHashMap.put(new StringBuilder("one"), 1);
     stringBuilderHashMap.put(new StringBuilder("two"), 2);
     ```

3. **Integer (Primitive) as a Key:**
   - Primitive data types, including `int`, cannot be used directly as keys in a `HashMap`. However, their corresponding wrapper classes, such as `Integer`, can be used.
   - Example:

     ```java
     HashMap<Integer, String> integerHashMap = new HashMap<>();
     integerHashMap.put(1, "one");
     integerHashMap.put(2, "two");
     ```

4. **Wrapper Integer as a Key:**
   - Instances of `Integer` (and other wrapper classes for primitive types) can be used as keys in a `HashMap`.
   - Example:

     ```java
     HashMap<Integer, String> integerHashMap = new HashMap<>();
     integerHashMap.put(new Integer(1), "one"); // Before Java 9
     integerHashMap.put(2, "two"); // Autoboxing (Java 9 and later)
     ```

   - Autoboxing allows you to use primitive literals directly as keys in a `HashMap` without explicitly creating instances of wrapper classes.


### 23. Can store primitive Integer as a value of hashmap?
    - In Java, the HashMap class only allows objects to be used as values. Primitive types, including int, cannot be directly used as values in a HashMap. However, you can use the corresponding wrapper classes for primitive types, such as Integer, to store integers as values.
----
## Types of Data Types:

### 1. Primitive:
In Java, there are eight primitive data types. They are:

1. **byte:**
   - 8-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -128 to 127.

   ```java
   byte myByte = 127;
   ```

2. **short:**
   - 16-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -32,768 to 32,767.

   ```java
   short myShort = 32767;
   ```

3. **int:**
   - 32-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

   ```java
   int myInt = 2147483647;
   ```

4. **long:**
   - 64-bit signed integer.
   - Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1.

   ```java
   long myLong = 9223372036854775807L;
   ```

5. **float:**
   - 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point.
   - Example:

   ```java
   float myFloat = 3.14f;
   ```

6. **double:**
   - 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point.
   - Example:

   ```java
   double myDouble = 3.14;
   ```

7. **char:**
   - 16-bit Unicode character.
   - Example:

   ```java
   char myChar = 'A';
   ```

8. **boolean:**
   - Represents true or false.

   ```java
   boolean myBoolean = true;
   ```

These primitive data types are used to represent simple values and are not objects. They have corresponding wrapper classes (e.g., `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Character`, `Boolean`) that allow them to be used in contexts that require objects, such as collections and generics.

### 2. Non-Primitive:
In Java, non-primitive data types are reference types or objects. They are instances of classes or interfaces, and they can be more complex than primitive data types. Here are some common non-primitive data types in Java:

1. **Object Types:**
   - The most general type, representing any object.
   - Example:

     ```java
     Object myObject = new Object();
     ```

2. **String:**
   - A sequence of characters.
   - Example:

     ```java
     String myString = "Hello, Java!";
     ```

3. **Arrays:**
   - Collections of elements of the same type.
   - Example:

     ```java
     int[] myIntArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     ```

4. **Classes:**
   - User-defined types that encapsulate data and behavior.
   - Example:

     ```java
     class MyClass {
         // class definition
     }

     MyClass myInstance = new MyClass();
     ```

5. **Interfaces:**
   - Defines a contract for implementing classes.
   - Example:

     ```java
     interface MyInterface {
         // interface definition
     }

     class MyImplementation implements MyInterface {
         // implementation of the interface
     }
     ```

6. **Enum Types:**
   - A special type that defines a set of constants.
   - Example:

     ```java
     enum Day {
         MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
     }

     Day today = Day.MONDAY;
     ```

7. **Collections:**
   - Various classes and interfaces in the `java.util` package that represent dynamic groups of elements.
   - Examples:

     ```java
     List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();
     Set<Integer> mySet = new HashSet<>();
     ```

8. **Maps:**
   - Classes in the `java.util` package that represent key-value pairs.
   - Example:

     ```java
     Map<String, Integer> myMap = new HashMap<>();
     ```

9. **Custom Classes:**
   - User-defined classes created to model specific entities or concepts in an application.
   - Example:

     ```java
     class Person {
         String name;
         int age;
     }

     Person person = new Person();
     person.name = "John";
     person.age = 25;
     ```
